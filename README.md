goal:

AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

critical functional elements such as requiring the salary to be entered as a number, displaying employee data in a table format, and consistently logging the required data into the console were not fully implemented.

Also, your code structure did not fully adhere to recommended practices. The repository lacked multiple descriptive commit messages (at least 5 but more is considered standard), and the README file was incomplete, missing a project description, screenshot, and a link to the deployed application. These elements are vital for clarity and usability for both reviewers and potential users.

Keep pushing forward, Andrew! It’s a lot to take in so you’ll get there if you practice. And remember to reach out to your instructional staff, tutor, and askBCS whenever you need assistance with challenges to help you make progress.
